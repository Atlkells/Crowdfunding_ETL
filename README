# Project 2
Group Members: Kelly Carter, Amanda Dunaway

The ETL_Mini_Project notebook file extracts and transorms crowdfunding data from two .xlsx files two create four DataFrames and export them as csv files. The Category and Subcategory Dataframes each contain category and subcategory ids and titles, respectively. The Campaign DataFrame contains fundraising data, each uniquely identified by an id, containing fundraising amounts, outcomes, and dates, among other information. The Contacts DataFrame contains the name and email address of campaign participants.

The relationships between the four exported csv files are sketched in the Crowdfunding_ERD png image. 

Lastly, a Crowdfunding database, crowdfunding_db, is created from the schema as outlined in the ERD. To create the database, we right-clicked on Databases in PgAdmin and clicked Create. We then opened a query tool and imported the .sql file we created in VSCode. A screenshot of the database with the four tables created is included in the repo. Finally, the four csv files are imported into their respective tables and verified.
